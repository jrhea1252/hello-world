# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Joel Rhea and I want to become a web developer to help my wife develop web application for students with learning disabilities and behavioral disorders. This is a second career for me. I appreciate the opportunity that Code You/Louisville is giving me. Thank you.
